Q. CAN A CONSTRUCTOR BE FINAL, STATIC OR ABSTRACT? WHY OR WHY NOT?

-->A constructor cant be inherited, so final is irrelevant
-->A constructor is used to create objects.static belongs to the class, not to objects.
-->Abstract means incomplete and not usable directly.Since constructors must run to create objects, Java does not allow abstract constructors.

Q.WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU EXPLICITLY DEFINE A CONSTRUCTOR WITH ARGUMENTS BUT NO DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR?

-->The default constructor is not automatically provided.Attempting to create an object with no arguments will result in compilation error.

Q.WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU CREATE AN OBJECT OF THE SUBCLASS?WHICH CONSTRUCTOR IS CALLED FIRST?

-->Parent (superclass) constructor is called first,then the child (subclass) constructor.

class Parent {
    Parent() {
        System.out.println("Parent constructor");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    Child() {
        System.out.println("Child constructor");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
    }
}

OUTPUT
Parent constructor
Child constructor

Q. WHAT HAPPENS IF A CONSTRUCTOR IS SYNCHRONIZED?

--> A synchronized constructor is allowed but makes no sense, as object-level synchronization is not applicable before the object is fully created.

Q. CAN A CONSTRUCTOR BE INHERITED?

--> No, but a subclass can call its superclass constructor using super();

Q. CAN A CONSTRUCTOR HAVE A RETURN STATEMENT?

--> No, Constructors cant return a value but they can have a return statement to exit early.
